# PDF Merge Tool for MacOS

Just a thin wrapper over the command I discovered [here](http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=2003083122212228).

## Usage

Copy the script somewhere on your machine, then create an alias in your ~/.profile file by inserting the line, eg

alias pdfmerge="~/Tools/pdfmerge.py"

File names can be input with or without the .pdf extension. When you are finished entering file names, a blank space will prompt for the output name.

In its current form the files input must be in the current working directory.
